    <title>GDigicam Overview</title>

    <para>GDigicam provides a high level Glib/GObject based library
    to easily access a digicam like GStreamer pipeline, simplifying
    the way in which a developer would create an application with
    such features.</para>
    <para>GDigicam includes a custom descriptor which provides the
    proper interfaces to interact with any GStreamer pipeline as if it
    would be a digicam featured pipeline. Therefore, a descriptor with
    a simple pipeline created from the GStreamer base plugins is
    included and further and more complete descriptors could be
    created by the developer or through external plugins.</para>
    <para>GDigicam was inspired in the OpenMAX 1.0 interface draft and
    is curretly in heavy development.</para>
